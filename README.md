# User Stories

As a user
I want to login into my data discover page
So only I and other authenticated users have access.

As a user 
I want to see a list of all the customers
So I can view and manage all customers in one place.

As a user 
I want to filter the list of customers by name
So I only see a list of relevant customers.

As a user 
I want to select a customer and see all the products they have ordered along with all the products' details and order details in a chronological order based on the order date
So I know precisely what each customer ordered and when it was ordered.

As a user
I want to switch between customers and view their order & product details
So itâ€™s easy to view the order details of multiple users in quick succession.
